MB MSDS

Quick and dirty application to easily display, filter, and manage a list of PDF files.  In this case it's being used as a front-end to an MSDS doc library.  We already had the folder structure and PDFs in place but wanted a way to easily filter through names/manufacturers and built this.

Backend is using a simple sqlite db with just 3 fields plus primary key, the code is mostly commented but it's also extremely simple so should be easy to figure out what's going on.  Probably a lot of room for optimization and to make better choices but you get what you pay for!
