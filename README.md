MB MSDS

Quick and dirty application to easily filter/search and then display MSDS PDF files from a network share.

Backend is a sqlite db, paths are hardcoded, not all errors are properly handled, and the code is ugly/not well commented so
I don't really recommend using this but it works so... there's that.
